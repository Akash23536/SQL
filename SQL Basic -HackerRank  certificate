Q -1

On the basis of merit, a company decides to promote some of its employee in its HR division at the end of the quarter because of their high performance.
Write a query to find the employee IDs along with the names of all its employees who work in the HR department 
who earned a bonus of 5000 dollars or more in the last quarter.

There are two tables in the database: employee_information and last_quarter_bonus. Their primary keys are employee_ID.


Explanation

There are two employees working in the HR department, with employee IDs 1 and 3. However, only employee with ID 3 has a bonus greater than equal to 5000,
and hence information about only that employee is displayed.
Employee 2, despite having a bonus of more than 5000 is not displayed because he does not belong to the HR department.




Answer-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SELECT e.employee_ID, e.name
FROM employee_information e
INNER JOIN last_quarter_bonus b
ON e.employee_ID = b.employee_ID
WHERE e.division = 'HR' AND b.bonus >= 5000;
